README
======

This is a collection of Perl scripts that take care of my basic JIRA needs:

+ Create an issue
+ Comment on the issue
+ Bump the issue's status (a.k.a., transition)
+ Close the issue (via transitions)
+ Search all the issues with JQL

Using these scripts, you can (probably?) completely avoid JIRA's web interface if you want.


Installation
------------

1. Clone it.
2. Fire up `cpan` (Perl's package manager) in your terminal to get [this one required library](https://metacpan.org/pod/JIRA::REST) for interacting with JIRA.  Make sure to set the environment variables shown below so the `cpan` client doesn't prompt you and just installs things.

        $ export PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1
        $ export PERL_EXTUTILS_AUTOINSTALL="--defaultdeps"
        $ cpan -f JIRA::REST # force install, it's probably fine
        ... stuff ...

3. Make sure your JIRA credentials are in your `.netrc` file, e.g.,

        machine https://foo.atlassian.net
        login rloveland
        password SECRET

4. Set the `ATLASSIAN_SERVER` environment variable with your JIRA server's URL. (It's used by the script to avoid hard-coding the URL.)

5. Link as many or as few of these as you want into your `~/bin`:
	+ `jira-search-issues`
	+ `jira-set-issue-status`
	+ `jira-add-comment`
	+ `jira-create-issue`

6. To see usage info for each script, call it with no arguments:

        $ jira-add-comment
        Usage: jira-add-comment ISSUE


Examples
--------

*Create an Issue*

Type this to create an issue with this title in the `DOC` queue:

    $ jira-create-issue DOC 'Update Frobnitz wiki page'

Then this script pops up `$EDITOR` to write a longer description.
It's pretty nice with `vim` or `emacsclient`, but it shouldn't matter.

*Comment on an Issue*

Add a comment like so:

    $ jira-add-comment DOC-123

This pops open `$EDITOR` to edit your comment.

*Search Issues*

The output of `jira-search-issues` is pretty dumb (just raw JSON).
It's not too hard to make it useful, though.  Here's an example using
it to print out all of your current work.  You need
[`jq`](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for this (you probably already
have `sed`):

    $ jira-search-issues "assignee = rloveland AND status not in (Closed, Resolved) ORDER BY status" \
    | jq '.key + " " + .fields.summary' | sed -e 's/\"//g';

	DOC-3260 Document new Foo screen
	DOC-867 Best practices for presenting information visually
	DOC-784 Update Insight wiki page with potential gotchas
	MS-774 Document ANAdDelegate AdListener calls

*Set an Issue's Status*

JIRA has some weird, arbitrary status codes.  There are a few useful
ones in the help output from the script:

	~/work/code/jira-scripts $ jira-set-issue-status 
	Usage: jira-set-issue-status ISSUE STATUS_ID

	Try one of these:

	| STATUS_ID | Meaning             |
	|-----------+---------------------|
	|        11 | 'Start Progress'    |
	|       141 | 'Start Code Review' |
	|       161 | 'Blocked'           |
	|       111 | 'Close'             |
	|       191 | 'Testing'           |
	|       261 | 'Resolve'           |

In other words, just type something like this:

    $ jira-set-issue-status DOC-123 191
